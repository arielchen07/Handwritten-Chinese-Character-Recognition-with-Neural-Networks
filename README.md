In this project, we explore the effectiveness of transfer learning using two pre-trained models, EfficientNet and InceptionV3+Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), for Handwritten Chinese Character Recognition (HCCR) on the Chinese MNIST dataset. We fine-tune these models on various training datasets and evaluate their performance. Our results demonstrate that augmenting the size and diversity of the training dataset can enhance model performance. These findings suggest that pre-trained models are a promising approach for HCCR and can be further improved by utilizing larger and more diverse training datasets.
